### Prompt 2

What is this document about? give me a brief summary about it

---

### Prompt 3

what is the project being working on this document about?

---

### Prompt 4

Is this document enough to start working on user stories, building a backlog and creating work tickets or does it need more work?

---

### Prompt 5

Let's try to proceed with the plan and estimation phase with the information provided in this document. Before we start provide a user story structure and a random example based on the project. Ask me questions whenever you need more information to execute the task given

---

### Prompt 6

1. I do not know the users of an ATS system, can you provide this information?
2. Main functionalities in the file been worked on, as some minimal basic ATS main functionalities that are needed.
3. Not at the moment but all of these points are important in the development.
4. Not at the moment, this is an initial plan and estimation phase.

Add these to your context and do not expand on them at the moment.

#### In response to:
Let me know if this structure aligns with your expectations, or if you’d like any adjustments. Also, here are some initial questions that could help refine the planning and estimation:

1. User Roles: Could you clarify all user roles (e.g., admin, regular user) and their primary functions?
2. Core Functionalities: Are there specific functionalities that need to be prioritized for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?
3. Non-Functional Requirements: Are there specific performance, security, or compliance requirements for any of the stories?
4. Timeline and Release Goals: Do you have a target timeframe or release schedule that should guide prioritization?

---

### Prompt 7

To start the planning and estimation take on the role of a product manager and create a single (and only one) user story. Do not create randomly but focus on a real user story that would add value to this planning and estimation

---

### Prompt 8-11

- perfect. Lets approve this story and start working on another story, still taking the role of a product manager
- this looks good, lets approve it and move on to the next user story
- good, lets alsp approve this user story. Now take on the role of a business analyst and propose a new user story
- this is good, approved. Propose a new user story

---

### Prompt 12

approved. Lets put a hold on main user stories and focus on the added value for LTI new ATS. Before proceeding with them, can you provide what is the main added value of this project based on the initial document?

---

### Prompt 13

what were the main 3 use cases described in the document?

---

### Prompt 14

from what i can read in the document the section added value specified

### **Added Value and Advantages**

- **AI-Powered Applicant Screening**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze resumes and rank candidates based on fit, significantly reducing manual screening time.
- **Real-Time Collaboration Tools**: Integrated platforms for communication between recruiters and hiring managers.
- **Automation of Routine Tasks**: Frees up HR professionals by automating scheduling and notifications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Quick adoption with minimal training.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Actionable insights via dashboards.
- **Scalability**: Easily integrates with existing HR systems and scales with the business.

### Prompt 15

let's explore stories specific to these elements. take again on the role of a product manager, let's keep on the flow of one user story at a time until it is approved

---

### Prompt 16

does this user story conflict, duplicate or extends on previously approved user stories?

---

### Prompt 17-19

- lets approve this story and move on to the next one
- approved, lets proceed with the next one
- approved. is there any specific needed user story before we proceed with building up the backlog?

---

### Prompt 20

approved. let's discuss the backlog before actually start building it, you can ask me any questions you need for it first

---

### Prompt 21

1. mvp
2. AI screening
3. do not know, will need your assistance on this.
4. secure data handling is the most important
5. not at the moment, this planning and estimation will provide the data needed to get a team and start building

Do not start directly with the backlog. first let's identify technical requirements needed 

#### In response to:
Great! With the core stories approved, the next step in building a meaningful backlog is organizing and prioritizing these stories to create a development roadmap. Here are some key questions to help shape a structured backlog and ensure alignment with project goals:

1. MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Definition: Are we aiming for a specific MVP scope? For example, do you want the initial release to cover only basic candidate management and status tracking, or should it include AI screening and automation features from the start?
2. Prioritization of Added Value: Among the added value features (AI screening, real-time collaboration, automation, analytics), is there a particular focus area or feature that holds more importance initially? This can help us structure the backlog to deliver high-impact features first.
3. Feature Dependencies and Integration Points: Are there any external systems or tools we need to integrate with early on, like calendar systems for scheduling or data sources for analytics? This would influence both the sequencing of stories and any preparatory tasks needed.
4. Non-Functional Requirements: Since performance, security, and compliance are important, are there specific benchmarks or standards we should aim for early on? This will help identify if we need additional stories focused on technical setup, such as secure data handling, compliance checks, or scalability testing.
5. Team Capacity and Timeline: Do you have any information on team size, expected sprint length, or project timeline? This can help us gauge how much work can fit into each sprint and inform our estimation of story size and sprint planning.

Once we have clarity on these points, we’ll be ready to structure the backlog, ensuring we have a focused and achievable development path. Let me know your thoughts on these!

### Prompt 22

this is good. Consider approved user stories for the backlog creation and prioritization, what would be the process to start this task?

---

### Prompt 23

provide a draft backlog for revision

---

### Prompt 24 (Using search the web feature)

make a table with these prioritization criteria for each user story.

1. Impact on user and business value
2. Urgency based on market tendencies and user feedback
3. Implementation complexity and estimated effort.
4. Risks and dependencies

---

### Prompt 25

with these data, does the draft backlog align?

---

### Prompt 26 (Using search the web feature)

is there any other prioritization methods we could apply to refine this backlog before approving it?

---

### Prompt 27 (Using search the web feature)

Take as much time as needed and perform these provided prioritization frameworks on the draft backlog, use basic data for decisions when needed or generics. Once finished let me know if the draft backlog is still looking good or any proposed changes that could be done to it.

---

### Prompt 28

ok this looks better, do we need to adjust the draft backlog based on this new data?

---

### Prompt 29

yes, lets approve this backlog. Now to finish take on the role of a scrum master and generate work tickets that will be used in the sprint 1 planning. Add an estimation effort to these tickets using both effort (with fibonacci) and units (hours and story points). Provide first a list of tickets first with title and their estimations without details so we can dive deep in each and start approving them

---

### Prompt 30

looks good, before proceeding what is the definition process for all these effort based on fibonacci, hours and story points. I want to learn these concepts and how they managed

---

### Prompt 31

that is good enough. Now lets proceed with reviewing the tickets, lets do it one by one following the approval flow 

---

### Prompt 32

should the entire database definition be part of the ticket?

---

### Prompt 33-38

- good, approved
- approved
- approved
- approved
- approved
- approved

---

### Prompt 39

is there a ticket to setup the logging mechanism/framework? like kibana or splunk?

---

### Prompt 40

lets break down this ticket in 2

---

### Prompt 41-44

- both approved
- approved
- approved
- approved

---

### Prompt 45

let's create a markdown document with all the information decided and approved. 

---

### Prompt 46

now create a markdown document with the backlog information 

---

### Prompt 47

and to finish, create a markdown document with the user stories

---

### Prompt 48

are these user stories complete? im not seeing the dependencies and notes.

---

### Prompt 49

for the backlog document, include all the analysis done with prioritization frameworks, table results and decisions

---

### Prompt 50

It seems the document was generated with errors. Create a new document with the prioritization analysis and tables
